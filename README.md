## About Me
👋 Hello! 
I'm Alexander Vandenberghe, an architect and BIM (Building Information Modeling) specialist, currently part of the innovative team at Bureau Bouwtechniek 🟥.
My passion lies in the confluence of architecture, technology, and education.

### Educational Background
- **Architectural Studies**: Graduated as an architect from the Luca School of Arts at KULeuven.
- **Teaching**: Currently teaching at Thomas More University, where I guide students in the Exept class focused on parametric design and deliver the Master Building Intelligence course.

### Professional Experience

- **POLO-architect**: Worked as a project architect and BIM model manager, contributing my expertise in architectural design and BIM processes.
- **Previous Experience**: Contributed at Licence to Build Architects & Engineers as a project architect, EPB responsible, and BIM manager.

### Interests and Vision
- A strong proponent of BIM, enthusiastic about leveraging technology in architecture for efficient and sustainable designs.
- Particularly interested in Python programming and its applications in architecture and BIM.
- Professionally, drawn to projects that showcase geometrical architecture and incorporate the automation of architectural processes.
- My vision includes creating exemplary workspaces adhering to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles, promoting simplicity and effectiveness in design and collaboration.
- Whilst continuously seeking innovation in all aspects of my work, I am always exploring new ways to integrate cutting-edge technologies and ideas in the field of architecture.

### GitHub Presence
